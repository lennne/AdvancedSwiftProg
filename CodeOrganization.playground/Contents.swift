//encode a class can inherit traits from another class. This is called code inheritance. In practice, it's commonly referred to as sub classing.
//Inheritance describes the sharing of traits between a parent and child class.
//The parent class refers to the existing class, while the new class that inherits all properties and methods from the parent is called a child class.
//In short, code inheritance is a process of subclassing a class from another class.

//In a subclass, you have implementation details like properties and methods of a base class.
//But you donâ€™t always need or want to expose these details to the subclass or places. Access control will help with your code implementation exposure levels.
//you will learn about access control to restrict access to parts of your code from other code.
//You will learn to use access-level modifiers to add different levels of code restrictiveness. Access control works with data types (like class and structure instances), properties, methods, and more.
